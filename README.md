# Developing-Data-Products
The final course project for the Coursera class from Johns Hopkins: Developing Data Products

- To use this app one must select a variable from the selection box and look at the box plot on the main panel to see that variables relationship with temperature. It is very simple. 
- There is a second tab that includes all of the supplemental information about the app including more information about how to use the app. 
- The data comes from the R data set 'airquality'.
- It includes 6 variables: Ozone, Solar Radiation, Wind, Temperature, Month, and Day.
- One should know that looking at the day as it relates to temperature is meaningless. 
- This should cover the documentation requirements of this assignment.
